Models suggest that productivity should increase with warming climate, due to increased metabolic activity.  However, this study argues that a widespread decline in productivity of boreal forests is seen, and is caused by increased evapoative demand by large trees. Productivity increases are only seen in tundra and areas not optimal for tree growth. The authors argue that this provides evidence for a continental scale biome shift along the forest-tundra ecotone.}
